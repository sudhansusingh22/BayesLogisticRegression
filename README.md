# BayesLogisticRegression
Sentiment analysis over IMDB-movie reviews and Twitter data using Logistic regression and Naive Bayes' classifiers from Pythonâ€™s machine learning package: scikit-learn.


	* Perform sentiment analysis over IMDB movie review data and Twitter data using supervised learning techniques, Logistic    regression and Naive Bayes Classifiers.
	* The data set contained 50,000 movie reviews from IMDB and around 900 K tweets. 
	* The raw data were filtered using NLP techniques and converted in to features and then converted into feature vectors.
	* Later on, the words list were labelled using Doc2Vec technique.
	* The model was trained and tested using Bayes Naive Classifiers and Logistic regression.
	* The accuracy of the model was 84%.
